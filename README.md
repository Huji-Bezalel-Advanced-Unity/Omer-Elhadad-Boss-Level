Absolutely — here’s the revised, professional-style `README.md` text with the phase system and attack details included clearly and naturally:

# Holy Spit

**Holy Spit** is a fast-paced 2D boss fight game developed in Unity. Inspired by games like *Cuphead*, it delivers a short but intense challenge focused on dodging, timing, and well-placed spit attacks. You play as a Moroccan fighter standing up to a monstrous hot pepper plant — an exaggerated version of the pain he's endured every family dinner.

This was a solo project built over the course of about a month, with a focus on expressive pixel art, satisfying gameplay mechanics, and replayable difficulty.

## About the Game

The game centers around a single boss encounter that evolves over time. The fight gets progressively harder as the plant begins to crack — both visually and mechanically.

**Phase System:**

* **Phase 1 (Normal):** Basic projectile attacks
* **Phase 2 (Crack 1):** The boss begins spawning zombies to increase pressure
* **Phase 3 (Crack 2):** The boss starts spawning water pulse waves that cover larger parts of the arena

Each phase becomes more densely packed with hazards and enemy behavior, requiring quick reactions and better use of your movement and attack options.

## Key Features

* One focused boss fight with **multiple escalating phases**
* Tight, responsive platforming and dash controls
* **Large vs. small spit attacks** (larger deals more damage but has a delay)
* Hand-drawn 2D pixel art created specifically for this project
* Sound design that gives the fight a strange, fun energy
* Built for short sessions with long-term replayability

---

## Controls

* **Arrow Keys** – Move
* **Space / Up Arrow** – Jump
* **Shift** – Dash
* **X** – Spit Attack (tap for small, hold for large)
* **Z** – Switch spit mode
* **Escape** – Show instructions and key bindings

> Tip: Larger spit attacks deal **more damage**, but are slower to fire — perfect for well-timed windows.

## Platforms

* Windows
* macOS
* Linux
* Web (WebGL)

> Not supported on mobile.

## Development Notes

Everything in *Holy Spit* — design, art, code, gameplay logic — was created solo. The boss's phase progression and enemy design were carefully tuned to keep the pressure increasing without becoming overwhelming. Special care was taken to make the attack patterns feel learnable but still dynamic, rewarding players who take time to read and adapt.

Visual changes in the boss (such as cracks forming) help signal danger and build anticipation. The phase system allows for controlled escalation that pushes the player to improve each run.

## Feedback

I'm planning on expanding this fight with more polish, additional attack patterns, and possibly extra phases.
If you have thoughts, ideas, or find bugs — feel free to open an issue or reach out.
